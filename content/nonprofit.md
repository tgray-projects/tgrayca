### Projects done for community benefit.

#### Powell River Technology Coop
The purpose of the Coop is to promote technological product development in Powell River by providing opportunities and assistance and to build a strong community and a diverse local tech economy based on mutual support, fair prices, living wages, and respect for the natural and technological systems which sustain life.

To do this, the Coop operates and maintains a publicly shared workshop (the Powell River Makerspace) with a focus on technologically driven small scale manufacturing and prototype design.

Additionally, the Coop is working with the civic government, educational leadership, and community partners to develop a local innovation center, expanding on the Makerspace concept to include art, textile work, and other types of small-scale manufacturing and development.  The innovation center will also include a marketplace and training areas in an effort to reduce the time from concept to local market.
