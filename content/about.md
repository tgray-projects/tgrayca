Software development, system administration, database design, deployment processes, change management, project management using agile and scrum, QA and test automation, requirements gathering and business analysis, interface design and UX testing, and development process management.

Not-for-profit administration involving the organization of volunteer resources with differing skillsets and mindsets to move forward in a (mostly) common direction.  Non-deterministic research and development on small-scale local manual and automated manufacturing.

Homesteading on a small farm on the west coast of Canada, living in an area known locally as "Paradise Valley" on the Sunshine Coast while telecommuting on a fibre internet connection.  Troubleshooting code and tractors in equal parts some days.

But mostly, I love technology.
